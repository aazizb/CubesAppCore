Given two aligned cubes: cube A with center Point(a, b, c) and with edge length L; 
cube B with center Point(d, e, f) and with edge length M
Design an application with the following requirements:

1.The application should check wether the two cubes collide; if so
2.Calculate the intersected volume.

Implementation:
Use TDD in C# to develop requirements in .NET applications.
Use the fluent builder pattern to create cubes. By doing so, we can create cubes 
step by step, and then connect all the parts together, thus avoiding complex constructor. It's a grood practice in OOP.
